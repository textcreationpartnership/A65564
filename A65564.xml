            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>An Account of the Occaſion, Deſign, and Nature of the Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE true and ſole <hi>occaſion</hi> of the two following diſcourſes was the deſire of a Reverend and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily Pious perſon to me, upon the <hi>third Edition</hi> of the <hi>Method of private Devotion,</hi> that I would inſert ſome thing thereinto, briefly and by the by, to caution many (otherwiſe devout) of
<pb facs="tcp:106285:4"/> frequenting <hi>Plays</hi> and ſpending their time in ſuch <hi>Vanities,</hi> which too often prove not only <hi>Impediments</hi> to <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but (as the generality of them are ordered) the bane of good minds. This when I had a little thought upon, I did not, at the firſt, ſee a place to my mind for ſuch inſertion. Then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the <hi>ſtage</hi> to be the <hi>only</hi> nor perhaps <hi>moſt common Impediment</hi> of Devotion. And farther, I judged, that ſhould I only have briefly touched the ſubject intimated, two Editions of that Book being then but lately bought off, thoſe which were by them furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would ſcarcely buy Books of the third for the addition of a few lines; and poſſibly others but ſlightly remark ſo brief ſuggeſtions. Beſides, laſtly, I ſoon ſaw, that to <hi>enumerate</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi> the <hi>common hinderances</hi> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion would take up more room and pains then was conſiſtent with ſuch an <hi>inſertion.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106285:4"/>
            <p> I reſolved therefore on a diſtinct trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. And remembring that I had met with ſome pieces, by men of highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended reaſon and learning, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a <hi>natural Religion</hi> compriſed in a <hi>few principles</hi> that <hi>run through all</hi> Religions, boldly aſſert all the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> and <hi>offices particular</hi> to each, to be only of <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>Politick</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution (and conſequently no <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Poſitive Worſhip</hi> of divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, nor any point, by Chriſtianity a Duty, which is not and was not ſuch by the law of nature). And withal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on the uſual diſcourſes of the <hi>Hectorly Rationaliſts</hi> of our Age, who greedily lick up, and as raſhly vent thoſe others ſpittle, I thought this plauſible ſuggeſtion of the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of a general fairneſs or <hi>imaginary vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> to be the moſt malignant and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent prepoſſeſſion againſt all Devotion, and Divine Worſhip (as being a plain
<pb facs="tcp:106285:5"/> ſubverſion of its ſeveral offices) and therefore reſolved firſt and by it ſelf to accoſt it, as requiring more of diſcourſe, and then thoſe other more vulgar Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, each in their Order. Thus came one intended tract to be broke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two pieces.</p>
            <p>Now as to what I have done in my attempts on both, my <hi>Reader</hi> is to be <hi>advertiſed,</hi> that he expect not <hi>(firſt) higher notions</hi> or <hi>ſtyle,</hi> than ſuch which it is fit to addreſs to popular or middle capacities. The Philoſopher has told us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: And I handle theſe ſubjects for the benefit of men of moderate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments: (Men of truly high learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are above being impoſed upon by ſuch opinions as I engage). Nor (ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly) <hi>ſtricter demonſtrations,</hi> than is poſſible to be given of ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106285:5"/> is made up of articles <hi>Hiſtorical, Doctrinal,</hi> or <hi>Moral:</hi> and the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> of each <hi>different</hi> according to the nature of each. Of the <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> points (as the Birth, Life, Crucifixion, and Reſurrection of our Saviour, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> we have not, nor pretend to have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Evidences</hi> than <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> both <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>humane:</hi> and that not only conſigned in writing, but atteſted by many viſible events and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>doctrinal</hi> Articles (ſuch as the Creation, the life everlaſting, and different eſtates therein) we have firſt the ſame evidences as in the former caſe, and we have beſides, for ſome of them the <hi>demonſtrative,</hi> or moſt <hi>highly probable</hi> Ratiocinations of our own minds: and <hi>others</hi> of them, which are not thus demonſtrable, are evident <hi>conſequents</hi> of thoſe that are. Thus, From the courſe of nature and
<pb facs="tcp:106285:6"/> 
               <hi>generation,</hi> we are enforced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a <hi>firſt cauſe</hi> or a Creator of all. From the firſt and experienced actings and <hi>properties</hi> of our Souls, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conclude their <hi>immateriality,</hi> and thence their incorruptibility or <hi>immortality.</hi> From the <hi>Creation,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and <hi>conſtitution</hi> of things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the infinite <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>Creator,</hi> his <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>providence.</hi> And from <hi>Providence, Juſtice,</hi> and the <hi>immortality</hi> of humane <hi>Souls</hi> (conſidering the different lives and manners of men, and how here they carry all away) is conſequent a <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of <hi>eſtates</hi> in that future immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life, that is an <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> I might run the Chain to a far greater length. But, laſtly, as to the <hi>moral</hi> points of Chriſtianity: We have for them, firſt, the <hi>common evidence</hi> of both the former, <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony</hi> that they were inſtituted by
<pb facs="tcp:106285:6"/> God. We have beſides an <hi>intrinſical evidence</hi> for them, founded in the nature of the Duties and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruency to the principles of our own reaſon, whence ariſeth that <hi>approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which natural <hi>Conſcience</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but give unto them. (We are not able but to commend and approve Temperance, Chaſtity, Meekneſs, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifullneſs, Juſtice, and Piety, though poſſibly, by reaſon of carnal cuſtom or intereſt; we have no great ſtomach to practiſe them.) And hence if we do not conclude, that the laws, which enact theſe, are the laws of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour (as methinks we ſhould) yet we muſt acknowledge them <hi>fit</hi> to be enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him and <hi>worthy of him:</hi> and then this, together with the <hi>teſtimony</hi> which they otherwiſe receive, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force their reception. Now as to thoſe Chriſtian Duties which are of a <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> nature, their ſingular <hi>conducive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106285:7"/> to <hi>virtue</hi> will ſpeak them moſt <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> for obſervation, ſo that if the Holy Creator would enact any outward worſhip, it is fit theſe ſhould be it, as ſo highly tending to the natural and eternal part of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: and then the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> and <hi>inviolable tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> (that is almoſt the World) ſuperadded thereto, will make up a Plea, beyond all rational contradiction for our embracing alſo this part of Chriſtianity. By all which it may ſoon be perceived what <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>poſitive worſhip</hi> I aſſert in the parts of the former following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Chapter, having ſuppoſed the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>providence,</hi> and the <hi>juſtice</hi> of both (which are granted even by the worſt, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any Religion) I aſſert a <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Divine Will</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106285:7"/> (and therefore a <hi>determining</hi> of the <hi>offices</hi> of <hi>Divine Worſhip)</hi> to be if not a <hi>neceſſary,</hi> yet moſt highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable <hi>conſequent</hi> from thence.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond, admitting that ſo highly applauded principle (and if rightly ſtated, truly worthy, Heroical, and Evangelical) that Virtue is the great and to God moſt acceptable, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, I aſſert the poſitive offices of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Worſhip to be <hi>neceſſary</hi> as moſt natural proper <hi>means</hi> for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting growth and ſecurity of Virtue.</p>
            <p>In the third, ſuppoſing none, who admit the truth of Scripture or of Chriſtian Religion, can deny or doubt the particular offices of Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to be of Divine Inſtitution, from the irrefragable <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion,</hi> and ſo of the ſubſtance of <hi>Scripture,</hi> I aſſert the aforeſaid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Chriſtian Worſhip <hi>neceſſary</hi> as
<pb facs="tcp:106285:8"/> being preſcribed or matter of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And being I apprehended very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable evidence was given for making good all theſe aſſertions, I added that theſe offices were <hi>Reaſonable</hi> as well as <hi>Neceſſary.</hi>

            <p>In the ſecond diſcourſe, though my deſign may ſeem to engage me more with the <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> than <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> yet being I judged the beſt mean for ſwaying them to be deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effectually with Reaſon and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have therefore endeavoured, that the particular proceſſes in each caſe might carry ſuch weight of reaſon in them, as might approve them to any conſiderative and intelligent mind, and ſo in a manner enforce their practice, or at leaſt leave the neglectour unexcuſable. They conſiſt therefore of particulars all (or moſt) of them (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing us Chriſtians) in our own <hi>power,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106285:8"/> and beſides <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> to the caſes for which they are preſcribed as remedies, and laſtly <hi>enforced</hi> by the <hi>common</hi> and moſt demonſtrable <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I often herein proceed upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular foundations which Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Adminiſters, proper to the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective deſign I proſecute. But I take that to be little leſs legitimate proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it is argued from propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before evinced (as the truth of Revelation and Scripture is ſuppoſed to be by the former diſcourſe) than if it were argued from principles ſelf evident.</p>
            <p>This is all the <hi>recommendation</hi> of or <hi>Apology</hi> for my following work which I had or thought neceſſary to make. I have therefore now only to <hi>beſeech</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that it may be as ſucceſsful as I wiſh't it, and of the
<pb facs="tcp:106285:9"/> 
               <hi>Reader</hi> that it may be as honeſtly and innocently entertained as I meant it; and I doubt not much of the happy event of either, where it ſhall be read with an honeſt deſign of practice, more than Cenſure.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us <hi>return</hi> a little back to our own <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> and in them view the guilt and unworthineſs by them charged on our ſelves. We ſhall there, or in the Regiſter of our own Conſciences, find ſins vaſtly <hi>numerous,</hi> and of very <hi>heinous</hi> natures, which have run through every part of our life, and vitiated eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our faculties. We ſhall find, that, were all our ſins of ignorance, infirmity, ſurrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſurpriſal, ſtruck off the ſcore, and we only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for <hi>preſumptuous</hi> and more deliberate <hi>commiſſions,</hi> and <hi>omiſſions,</hi> our guilt for theſe ſolely is ſo great, that, conſidering all the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106285:34"/> of Virtue, which we have had, we cannot but admire that divine vengeance hath not made us examples. And beſides acts of ſin, what a number of dreadful evils now habitually rooted in us and very far from being mortified? Now is it poſſible perſons thus vitious can be conceited of their virtues? If after this any titillations of ſelf-conceit remain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> let us weigh how <hi>unproportionable</hi> the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our <hi>better acts</hi> is to the heinouſneſs of our <hi>bad ones.</hi> Of our good deeds, as already ſaid, there is none pure, none but what is miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably imperfect. And of like nature are all our habitual excellencies and virtues, in a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106285:35"/> poor mean degree, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclinations or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to virtue, than habits of it. But on the contrary, our ſins moſt of them are ſo purely ſuch, that they ſcarce or not at all admit excuſe, and we our ſelves are or have been ſenſible of it. And as in <hi>nature</hi> ſo in <hi>number</hi> our <hi>vitious</hi> acts <hi>exceed</hi> our <hi>good</hi> ones. To one tear dropt for any ſin, we may reckon twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſins committed. And can a perſon cloth'd with ſuch a body of guilt, be proud of a rag or two of his own righteouſneſs. A rag I ſay, for let that, <hi>thirdly,</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,</p>
                     <p>That even our beſt acts are miſerably tainted, and theſe eſpecially which we are now
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106285:35"/> apt to be conceited of by theſe very conceits become defiled. The better we think of them the worſe they are, and our opinion of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts from their real worth. Shall we then ſo guilty wretches, whoſe virtues are ſo mean and few, harbour thoſe conceits which will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoil thoſe our very Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues? Theſe things duely weighed, it is to be hoped may repreſs this tumour, and ſo the way is clear to <hi>remove</hi> all thoſe <hi>impediments</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip which may be thought to proceed properly from the <hi>Devil.</hi>

And it is moſt certain, he who wants two or three thouſand a year, more than I do, to live, by the acceſſion of ſo much more than I have,

And when we conſider duly the original fault of miſ-pend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good hours, can we think it venial?

                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:106285:39"/> mainly I can find <hi>no leiſure,</hi> or which is the ſame I <hi>want</hi> it: that is, <hi>I have time for any thing but to be a good Chriſtian.</hi> Will I ſay this caſe paſs with the approbation of a good Conſcience?

                     <p>But ſuppoſe in this caſe Conſcience ſhould excuſe (which yet is evident, if ſound, ſhe will not) yet the time now apace drawing on, when <hi>every work</hi> ſhall be <hi>brought into judgment,</hi> and the <hi>Books</hi> ſhall be <hi>opened</hi> (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Books,</hi> as they can be no leſs, <hi>Gods Omniſcience,</hi> and my <hi>own Conſcience,</hi> both, as to what concerns me, made manifeſt, and as it were legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) if my Conſcience ſhould have been by my deſigned <hi>oppoſition</hi> or ſophiſtication of

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106285:41"/> the only or great neceſſary thing? In ſhort, either have we placed happineſs in this World, or in that unſeen one to come. If it be in that, <hi>where our treaſure is, there our heart will be alſo,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>muſt be often.</hi> But it it ſo come to paſs that touching <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>World above,</hi> our <hi>hearts</hi> can find no time to buſy themſelves; when we pleaſe to be honeſt to our ſelves, and no longer bribe our own judgments, we may and muſt throw up all our pretences and hopes to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and <hi>inviſible treaſure;</hi> for had we any ſuch, it would have more room in our ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſiderations and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. So that, in fine, the matter is evidently reduced
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106285:41"/> hither; that either our more <hi>leiſurely time</hi> (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we idly ſpend) if any ſuch we have, muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon <hi>ſacred Duties;</hi> or if we have none ſuch, then that ſo much time as may <hi>ſuffice</hi> for theſe, be <hi>cut off</hi> from our immoderate (and more than needful) imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and dedicated to thoſe Duties.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106285:42"/> multitude of <hi>buſineſs,</hi> will be the more reaſonable, if we conſider, that in ſuch eager purſuit after this World, we are not able to enjoy it, and while all our time is imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get, we have none left wherein to poſſeſs what we have gotten. It is certain, all the <hi>goodneſs</hi> there is in <hi>rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> lies in their <hi>uſefullneſs;</hi> in as much as they are only <hi>bonum in Ordine ad aliud,</hi> a good by reaſon of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciveneſs to ſomewhat elſe: from whence it neceſſarily follows, that he who <hi>looſeth</hi> the <hi>uſe</hi> of his eſtate, looſeth all the <hi>good</hi> there is in it. So that for a man to be ever plodding, contriving, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiling further to enrich himſelf, when by Gods good
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106285:42"/> providence he hath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal, comfortably, and competently to ſuſtain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his, is only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive himſelf of that good, which is in the power of his hand to enjoy, for that which will never be good to him; that is for more wealth, which when he hath, he will never have an heart or time to uſe, that is, he will never reap good of it. So that whether a man reſpect his <hi>preſent</hi> or <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> felicity, it is evident he <hi>looſeth</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> and very much <hi>infringes</hi> the <hi>other,</hi> by ſuch reſtleſs incumbrances and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votedneſs to this Worlds affairs.</p>

                     <p> To conclude this point; it may be obſerved, that in all this diſcourſe againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment of worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs upon our time and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, nothing hath been ſaid to direct the redeeming of time, by <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>watching,</hi> and ſuch ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing means: in as much as it was not judged proper to the Caſe. For neither is it reaſonable to think, that he who cannot impetrate of himſelf <hi>abſtinence</hi> from <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> incumbrances for the ſake of divine Duties, for the ſame will <hi>abſtain</hi> from <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>ſleeping,</hi> or any ſuch which ſeem neceſſary acts of life; nor can he be thought a fit hearer of ſuch Doctrines, which lead a man to retrench
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106285:46"/> himſelf of what he lawfully may do (of which nature is eating and ſleeping, &amp;c.) who hath not yet learned to deny himſelf of what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly ſinful; <hi>viz.</hi> immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate purſuit of this World, and placing his whole time and therefore happineſs therein. This may therefore be ſufficient for remedying thoſe impediments of divine worſhip which come from wordly cares and buſineſs.</p>

                     <p>This by the way duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered may deliver us from being <hi>abuſed</hi> with that <hi>new conceit</hi> (as moſt of them uſe to be fond and temerarious) that it is a more expedite way to knowledge, to ſtudy men (that is, to keep Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, dwell in Coffee-houſes, and Taverns, &amp;c. inſtead of our privacies) than to ſpend our time in Books.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106285:52"/> but it is induſtry and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in private which is the main, ſureſt, and ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved expedient to make us either wiſe or virtuous.</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106285:84"/> put thoſe men upon reſtleſs importunities and plots, by which the reſolution of the weaker ſex (of force, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſufficient to have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood leſs rampant temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or addreſſes) hath been at length overcome, and once baffled, hath never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it ſelf, but become debauched to eternal infamy. Where this doth not follow, yet is it evident, it breeds in them <hi>pride</hi> and a <hi>vain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring</hi> of themſelves, and <hi>ſcorning</hi> others; with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral like evils no wiſe toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>thirdly,</hi> let it be conſidered, that it certainly hath much <hi>guilt in it,</hi> though thoſe ſad conſequents ſhould not come to paſs. It partakes
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106285:85"/> of <hi>prodigality, ambition, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying,</hi> or vying others, <hi>rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>poor,</hi> and more ſins than it is eaſie to enumerate. The meer extravagancies perſons of good condition have been guilty of in theſe coſtly Vanities, make them <hi>think</hi> (ſometimes <hi>find)</hi> all too little for themſelves; and while they thus ſumptuouſly array themſelves, they almoſt ſtarve thoſe whom they ſhould relieve, not ſeldom thoſe whom they ſhould maintain; for even the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſometimes fares worſe, for the luxurious pride of the Miſtreſs, or Maſter.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> we ought and muſt account theſe part of the <hi>Pomps and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this wicked World,</hi>
                        <pb n="139" facs="tcp:106285:85"/> which in our <hi>Baptiſm</hi> we did renounce: there being ſcarce any thing imaginable, which we can more properly ſtyle by theſe names, than ſuch fruitleſs exceſs in this Caſe. To ſum up all then: Can any perſon, who conſiders theſe things, get leave of Conſcience and reaſon, to beſot themſelves on a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which <hi>can</hi> have <hi>no good deſign, hath</hi> many <hi>ill ends and effects,</hi> is beſides, in it ſelf fraught with <hi>guilt,</hi> and moſt <hi>ſacredly renounc't</hi> by the perſon peccant? Can any, I ſay, do this, when beſides all the mentioned injuries done unto themſelves and others; this alſo is added to the ſum, that hereby they are induced to neglect God and their
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106285:86"/> Souls. To be guilty of this, through employment other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and in it ſelf, good or innocent, being not tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, can it be excuſed that any becomes guilty hereof, for that which is manifeſtly wicked?</p>

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for moſt or every of his <hi>hours</hi> he hath had <hi>work,</hi> he hath the happy Proſpect of <hi>fewer</hi> loſt ones to account for: In the end of the day, he <hi>eats his bread</hi> with <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> and if he carry to Bed <hi>a weary</hi> Body, 'tis abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly <hi>recompenced</hi> with an <hi>eaſie mind,</hi> and <hi>ſweet ſleep,</hi> till the next Morning returns him, without dull Head-achs, or oſcitant qualms, or cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Clouds, like the <hi>Stars,</hi> only clearer by having ſet.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106285:98"/> it will after excite <hi>fortitude</hi> and conſtancy to ſuffice for its performance.</p>
                     <p>To conclude all this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: Whoever would break himſelf of an idle ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual habit, let him not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, in his <hi>firſt attempts,</hi> the daily, due diſcharge of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip.</hi> Beginnings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times are ominous; and he is likely to go worſt out of his way who miſſeth it at firſt ſetting out.

Which that we may the ſurer do, we muſt firſt conſider his <hi>power.</hi> The <hi>ſhorter</hi> his <hi>reign</hi> hath been, the more <hi>eaſily</hi> will he be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</hi> Firſt, if we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our ſelves only to have been now and then in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate <hi>fit,</hi> our buſineſs will be only to <hi>prevent</hi> that paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>recurring.</hi> But, ſecondly, if the inordinacy of paſſion be become <hi>cuſtomary</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituate, not only preventive means muſt be uſed but <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpatory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the former caſe, I ſay, we are chiefly to take care for the <hi>preventing</hi> inordinacy
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106285:110"/> of the returning paſſions, which we find to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted us. And that will be done, <hi>firſt,</hi> by <hi>ſtudying</hi> the particular <hi>occaſions,</hi> which have raiſed paſſion to ſuch exceſs, and either avoiding, as far as may be, the <hi>things themſelves,</hi> which have been ſo unhappily inſtrumental, or <hi>arming our ſelves,</hi> and providing; if they cannot be conveniently avoided, (which, till we have a little maſtery of our ſelves, were ſafer) to manage them with temper and calmneſs. We muſt reſolve, it ſhall not be in the power of each Child and trifle to diſturb our quiet and reaſon. To this purpoſe we are to conſider, what it is in us which hinders
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:106285:110"/> ſuch temperate management; poſſibly ſome other luſt <hi>(whence come Wars and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings amongſt you but from your luſts,</hi> &amp;c.) and then care muſt be taken for the removing and mortifying that. For inſtance, in the caſe of <hi>anger;</hi> Reflecting on my ſelf, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I find I have, or too or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily do betray a pitiful and impotent Spirit, by <hi>talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> my ſelf into anger; which to the end I may remedy, I conſider firſt, whether I can <hi>avoid</hi> conteſting diſcourſes. And finding it in a manner impoſſible to live in the the World (at leaſt in my own particular ſtation) but I muſt ſometimes be ingaged therein; <hi>I examine</hi> what it is <hi>hinders</hi> that I cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106285:111"/> any controverſy, but I run upon this rock of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Searching then the <hi>cauſes,.</hi> One haply I find to be, an <hi>high conceit</hi> of my ſelf which begets contempt and ſecret ſcorn of others. If therefore in diſcourſe any keep not that diſtance, which my pride thinks meet they ſhould, or ſeem other ways by themſelves or others e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled to me, my diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is moved and rage pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently inflamed.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond reaſon, but flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence, poſſibly may be <hi>ambition,</hi> and a deſire not ſo much to <hi>be</hi> learned, as to be <hi>reputed</hi> ſuch. It may be, I cannot endure to have my reaſon over-maſtered, when I have once engaged, or to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:106285:111"/> give place in any knowledge which I pretend too, and yet too raſhly pretend to all.</p>
                     <p>Again, it is not impoſſible but that <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> may be a partial root of this evil: For deſiring a riſe, it may ſeem a prudential mean hereto to be ready by all methods (of which I may think over-talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others may be a vulgar one) to repreſent my ſelf as one who deſerves it.</p>
                     <p>The only courſe then here, for certain prevention of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate anger, is to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the <hi>mortifying pride, ambition,</hi> and <hi>worldly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,</hi> to take up mean thoughts of my ſelf, and be content with my preſent ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and moderate proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But for as much as the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:106285:112"/> forementioned occaſion of this paſſion may be much avoided, and many a conteſt waved, I muſt therefore, as far as may be, endeavour that, by reſolving and taking care; <hi>firſt,</hi> not to put my ſelf on diſputative diſcourſe without due enforcement. And if, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> upon ſuch engaged, to diſcourſe ever with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of my own infirmity, and a jealous watch over my waſpiſh mind. With ſuch caution armed I ſhall prevent the hurt, though I could not avoid the danger.</p>
                     <p>For the better practice of this firſt rule, it will concern us, that we often <hi>conſider</hi> our <hi>buſineſs before hand,</hi> and <hi>avoid,</hi> in perſon, ſuch matters, as may embroil by employing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:106285:112"/> friends, reſolving rather to ſuſtain and devour little loſſes and affronts, than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit our temper and calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſome other little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients, which prudence will ſuggeſt. Tis true indeed none of mankind hath the power of preſcience, nor can we foreſee all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and perplexities of our affairs, but ſuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proſpect of them any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderative man may have, who pleaſeth, as may help to deliver him, if diſcreetly managed, from a multitude of extravagancies of this kind.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> rule will be (where the firſt hath not, or could not be practiced) that, when we find occaſions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:106285:113"/> and paſſion now working, we <hi>repreſs</hi> it <hi>early,</hi> by conſulting reaſon and our own reſolutions of a calm, or, if this cannot be, by <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi> the paſſion by other imployment of our ſenſes and powers. In love; if looks inflame, I can divert them, and go and contemplate a <hi>Skeleton,</hi> &amp;c. In anger; if diſcourſe embroil, I can ſhut up my mouth, or leave the Company, or engage in other diſcourſe with ſome more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned perſon. In grief; if I muſt indulge lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and tears, I can go to Prayers, and there vent them, turning natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into grace. If either of theſe rules take place the paſſion arrives not at its
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106285:113"/> height, and ſo the diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is prevented. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the winds up, and the tempeſt ſtrong, what courſe then to be taken ſo to govern the ſwoln mind, as that it may not rage beyond Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                     <p>Here the way will be, <hi>firſt,</hi> while the <hi>memory</hi> of every paſſage is yet <hi>freſh,</hi> to fit down and <hi>conſider,</hi> how ſtrangely we have <hi>forfeited</hi> our <hi>ſelves,</hi> what Fools or Beaſts we have been. Where was our reaſon, and thoſe noble powers, by which we ſhould have juſtly weighed, and gravely born all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of life? Remember, peeviſh man, the <hi>commotion</hi> of <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>ſpirits</hi> thou now felteſt, yea but the very out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:106285:114"/> 
                        <hi>change</hi> of <hi>viſage,</hi> which in like fits thou haſt ſeen in others, and hadſt thou had patience to have lookt in a Glaſs, mighteſt lately have done in thy ſelf; and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable theſe tumults to their true and firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? Further, what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable <hi>violations</hi> of what <hi>became</hi> thy degree, haſt thou been guilty off? What <hi>mean condeſcenſions</hi> muſt thou be put to in the end for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation? In a word all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, will not the <hi>ſum</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily <hi>ſhame</hi> thee into peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and an holy confuſion before God, and ſo bring thee on thy knees.</p>
                     <p>But if the paſſion be ſo <hi>headſtrong</hi> as that it expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſuch conſideration, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:106285:114"/> ſeems not only an Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Devotion but to thought too, headlong as thou art run into thy <hi>Cloſet,</hi> and fall down before God: thou haſt helps, pour out ſuch <hi>Prayers</hi> as thou canſt, and if thou canſt pour out none, kneel ſilent, and, as if by a <hi>mute confeſſion,</hi> ſhew to Heaven, what thou canſt not expreſs, thy <hi>diſorder'd Soul;</hi> this practice ſhall either appeaſe thee, or turn thy paſſions which way they ought, into more fervent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.</p>
                     <p>This I truſt may cure a <hi>fit</hi> of any paſſion: but where it hath got through frequent indulgence an <hi>habitual Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> the <hi>cure</hi> will be longer and more difficult, yet may
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106285:115"/> it in good meaſure be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>firſt,</hi> by <hi>refraining</hi> the <hi>actual eruptions</hi> of that paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whatever it is. For it is ſure, as it got this head by frequent Victories of reaſon, ſo by the ſame it ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its power. The former rules therefore are here with care and Conſcience, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the Divine Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to be again looked to and practiſed.</p>
                     <p>Further, it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whether common way of life, <hi>diet, converſe,</hi> and <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,</hi> occaſion not this enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and if it do, what may be changed or redreſt in any of theſe points is carefully to be ſtudied, and put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. It is certain, nothing ought to ſeem dear to us
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106285:115"/> in reſpect of our Souls; and we are to remember, the <hi>nouriſhing</hi> any <hi>inordinate paſſion</hi> in them, makes them properly <hi>unfit</hi> for <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>breeds</hi> within them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the very eſſence of the <hi>Helliſh Eſtate,</hi> habitual diſorder and inquietude.</p>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:106285:117"/> of private Devotion.

Now by <hi>Schiſm</hi> we know is meant a <hi>ſeparation</hi> from the <hi>common body</hi> or Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by <hi>Doctrines, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> or <hi>modes</hi> of <hi>worſhip</hi> of our own, contrariant to its determinations, laws, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106285:117"/> But as this ſin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt us in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſignifies nothing elſe, but a <hi>ſeparation</hi> from the <hi>Communion of our Church,</hi> a modelling little Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to rules dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the publick po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of the Church, or hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with theſe, ſo modell'd, in a <hi>ſingular</hi> and <hi>novel</hi> kind of Worſhip. Now this, I ſay, as it is evident by plain experience and matter of fact, that it takes off great numbers from the <hi>publick Worſhip</hi> of God, ſo is it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from Scripture, that it very much <hi>blaſts</hi> their <hi>private Devotions,</hi> both by <hi>debarring</hi> the perſons peccant of thoſe <hi>bleſſings</hi> of Heaven, which otherwiſe they would have

What then may Atheiſts and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men ſay of it, and how juſtifiable (through our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices) ſeem their Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Again, <hi>fourthly,</hi> may it not be obſerved that <hi>Schiſms</hi> ſtill have <hi>ruin'd</hi> thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> where they have prevailed? Nay, <hi>laſtly,</hi> do they not <hi>deſtroy</hi> common <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and <hi>induce Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Irreligion?</hi> Is it
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:106285:122"/> not plain, that men having once departed from the Church, make no end of ſwerving from the truth, till they come to plain Atheiſm? Being ſeduced to think their firſt Faith falſe, they eſpouſe a ſecond; and as they <hi>advance</hi> in <hi>novel ſpeculations,</hi> they are tempted to ſuſpect their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſwaſions, and then take up third ones contrary to both the former, and ſo onward, till reflecting upon themſelves, and ſeeing or imagining they have been <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> ſo <hi>often,</hi> they conclude <hi>all Religion</hi> to be but a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit;</hi> and accordingly <hi>caſt</hi> it off? Is any thing more obſervable amongſt our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Schiſmaticks than this? To conclude then this point
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:106285:122"/> of the miſchievouſneſs of Schiſm: if the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, which we by Schiſm rend, or <hi>intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which we here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſhonour and expoſe to the Blaſphemies of its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (by us juſtified) if the proſperity or quiet of this our <hi>native Church,</hi> which as far as in us lies we embroil, be at all <hi>dear</hi> to us, nay if we have any <hi>belief</hi> of, or <hi>reſpect</hi> and tenderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or any <hi>Religion</hi> at all; if we are touched with any <hi>regard</hi> to the <hi>Souls</hi> of our Chriſtian <hi>Brethren,</hi> or wear any <hi>love</hi> and concernment for our <hi>own</hi> Souls; by theſe and all theſe, as we would not have Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion driven out of the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:106285:123"/> World, nor our ſelves ſhut out of Heaven, are we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged and conjured to <hi>leave</hi> off <hi>Schiſmatical practices,</hi> to <hi>mortify</hi> all <hi>inclinations</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in our hearts, and to live in Communion, with and Conformity to our Mother Church.</p>
                     <p>Being thus cordially ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> of Schiſm, for the ſurer recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling our minds perfectly to the Church; <hi>thirdly,</hi> let us ſtudy and endeavour to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> our ſelves of the <hi>reaſon, intent,</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of thoſe things, which moſt offend us in the Church practice. For it is moſt certain the <hi>ignorance</hi> of theſe, is the greateſt <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>diſaffection</hi> to them. A great multitude of people
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:106285:123"/> were born and bred up in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and times, wherein the <hi>diſuſe</hi> of the preſent Orders of the Church hath made the uſe ſtrange to them; and again <hi>uſages contrary</hi> preoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated their minds with ſtrong prejudices againſt theſe. Theſe prejudices muſt be laid aſide (for it is very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to condemn a law or practice of the Church of God, becauſe it hits not our humour, or we underſtand it not) and the things in queſtion be conſidered with a calm and equal mind, and the Churches deſign, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the injunction, the liberty otherwiſe left, honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and evenly ponderated. And if there ſhould ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main one or two ſmall things,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:106285:124"/> touching the reaſon and meaning whereof we are yet to ſeek, we are not to be ſo <hi>unreaſonable</hi> as to <hi>decline</hi> all becauſe we <hi>underſtand not ſome</hi> little point; but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in an honeſt and devout Conformity and Communion ſo far as we underſtand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting quietly, and being ready to receive ſatisfaction in the reſt. And the practice hereof will not only other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bring the divine <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> upon us, but eſpecially fill our hearts with <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> from the ſenſe of our own minds being ſatisfied and peeviſh humours ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, and a ſweet Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion maintained with the full Aſſemblies of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Brethren, yea with all the

                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> For as much as it is certain, that Schiſms ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ariſe from particular mens <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>opinionative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of their intellectual Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, he that would through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly root this evil out of his heart, muſt <hi>ſtudy humility,</hi> modeſty, and meekneſs.

                     </p>
                     <p>In fine; the two firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations propounded may

And as to what elſe remains on our parts for its extirpation, it is in our own powers; to wit, that we <hi>tolerate</hi> not our ſelves in <hi>Schiſmatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,</hi> diſcourſe and ſociety, the <hi>bane</hi> of honeſt <hi>plain devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that we break off ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance that we reſort not to, nor maintain Covenant with, ſchiſmatical Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that, on the contrary, we <hi>return</hi> into the boſom of our <hi>deſerted Mother,</hi> and maintain devout Communion with her. Nor need it trouble us, if we have entred into <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> (as they call it) with this or that Schiſmatical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106285:126"/> to <hi>break</hi> with them: for, that <hi>Covenant,</hi> which took us off from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Catholick Church, being in it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful (that I ſay not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, ſinful and damnable) it is a <hi>ſin not to reform,</hi> that is, <hi>not to break it</hi> with <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> of heart, and <hi>prayer</hi> for forgiveneſs that ever we made it. And thus if we do, there is no doubt, by the bleſſing of God, we ſhall be delivered from Schiſm, nor with that hinder us in our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly courſe.</p>

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:106285:158"/> to receive the Scripture as to the general matter of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that being received as a truth, it is <hi>not poſſible</hi> to believe the great <hi>divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> can be the <hi>frauds</hi> of a particular <hi>crafty Prieſt;</hi> nor therefore is Chriſtianity or the Oracles we pretend to lyable to this challenge.</p>
                     <p>To proceed to that point which challengeth us to make out that theſe <hi>Oracles</hi> were deſigned to <hi>oblige</hi> all <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi> I anſwer it is <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi> And all we ſay, or need to ſay, is that they <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige</hi> all to whom they <hi>come</hi> with ſuch a <hi>ſufficient evidence</hi> of their verity, as delivered. And as to thoſe to whom they thus come not, thoſe very Oracles declare they
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:106285:159"/> ſhall be <hi>judged</hi> by <hi>another Law</hi> (none being to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe Laws ſave thoſe who had them).

As to all that now remains of what is charged againſt us, the ſum is, that, admitting what we have hitherto contended for, it is queſtionable whether theſe <hi>Oracles ſincerely deſcend</hi> to us, whether there are not various alterations and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polations. To which we ſay; it is certain holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (whoſe <hi>general verity</hi> we have hitherto found no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:106285:159"/> to challenge) expreſly <hi>requires</hi> us to <hi>receive</hi> the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> under pain of eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And it is as certain that it pretends to <hi>deliver</hi> that ſubſtance: (touching letters or particles we contend not). Now that God ſhould <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi> of us to <hi>receive</hi> the ſum of Chriſtian Religion under ſuch pain, and yet not by his <hi>providence order</hi> that it ſhould come <hi>ſincerely</hi> to us, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that in its <hi>eſſentials</hi> it ſhould deſcend only <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> is again <hi>irreconcileable</hi> with <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> (ſtill we ſhould be damned for what we could not help.) We muſt therefore conclude <hi>Scripture,</hi> in the <hi>neceſſaries</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantials</hi> of Chriſtian
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:106285:160"/> Religion <hi>ſincere</hi> and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. <hi>Various lections</hi> in this point <hi>need not</hi> create us <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> for they are ſeldom or never in paſſages aſſerting a <hi>ſubſtantial,</hi> or if one Text, which aſſerts a ſubſtantial, be ſo variouſly read, as that the matter is thence dubious, there are others which aſſert it, in which there is not that dubiouſneſs. Not to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that thoſe very <hi>various lections</hi> are in ſeveral regards an <hi>argument</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> being, in this ſenſe, <hi>ſincere:</hi> Inaſmuch as they ſpeak, <hi>firſt</hi> that <hi>great care,</hi> with which Scripture hath been ever kept, when the leaſt variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the received read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have been ſo religiouſly, that I do not ſay ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:106285:166"/> God which only makes the difference. The ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is apt alſo to habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate to <hi>patience,</hi> if we want, inaſmuch as becauſe <hi>asking</hi> them we either <hi>have</hi> them <hi>not,</hi> or only a <hi>ſlender portion</hi> given us, we cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that it is the will of the ſupreme God, that is, it is for our good, that it be ſo with us as it is. And (to mention no more) it cannot but very directly lead us to an <hi>improvement,</hi> I mean to a frugal yet grateful and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe of ſuch good things. For how ſhall we <hi>ask</hi> again if we <hi>prodigally ſcatter?</hi> or how ſhall we hope <hi>freely to receive</hi> if we will not <hi>freely give?</hi> It is then evident, that there is nothing which is by

                     <p>Hitherto we have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Prayer</hi> as made only in <hi>our own behalf.</hi> But di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oracles command us that we make alſo <hi>ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>giving of thanks for all men.</hi> Now this particular reſpect of prayer (under which conſidered we uſually name it Interceſſion) of what wholeſome uſe is it to the publick <hi>benefit</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Community?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that by this means we each enjoy the fruits of one anothers Prayers (which the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:106285:167"/> Chriſtian Doctrine teacheth us to believe) is it not a moſt effectual endearment of one another, that we daily pray from the bottom of our hearts each for the others good, both as to Soul and Body? So that conſequently it muſt ſingularly diſpoſe to, and inhance <hi>Charity,</hi> as that ſignifies <hi>loving one another.</hi> Of ſo great and various uſe and ſubſerviency to virtue is even <hi>private prayer:</hi> but we are alſo injoined the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the ſame office in <hi>publick bodies</hi> or Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; which beſides that it muſt needs promote <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Brotherly Love,</hi> ſo the office being thus made more ſolemn and <hi>auguſt,</hi> muſt needs have a ſtronger influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

                     <p>To conclude this point of Prayer. Both private and publick Prayer we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined often to <hi>repeat</hi> or fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. Thereby all theſe holy diſpoſitions and <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are more <hi>deeply imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in our hearts, and the nearer commencing ſetled and <hi>rooted habits,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>virtues.</hi> And both in private and publick Prayer we uſe <hi>words</hi> as well as thoughts, to keep our minds more intent unto the office, and its ſeveral parts that thereby we may the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto our ſelves the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral benefits. For we find our ſelves ſo accuſtomed to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:106285:168"/> utter our thoughts by words in other caſes, that we can ſcarce in this or any (at leaſt in a long ſeries) form our thoughts, except we alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in our minds words which for the main expreſs them. So that even the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>words</hi> and <hi>external modes</hi> of Prayer are not without ſome contributive energy to the ingenerating <hi>virtue</hi> in us. Nor has therefore God been <hi>arbitrary</hi> in the inſtitution of this office of Worſhip, which we call <hi>Prayer,</hi> in any part, reſpect, or mode of it, nor is it unreaſonable to be by us performed, albeit there were no ſuch thing as hearing or granting Prayers on Gods hand, which yet Chriſtianity aſſures us of.</p>

                     <p>Of Sacraments in this notion there are and can be but two; of which the firſt, <hi>viz. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> is an initiation of us into <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

On our part therefore it muſt lay a moſt <hi>Solemn obligation</hi> upon us to abandon vice and practice virtue, as being a ſacred ſign or rite by which we plight our troth, and are devoted to the ſervice of that God, whom Chriſtianity teacheth us to be Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, this being the meaning of being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into their name, that we are by baptiſm conſecrated to their ſervice and accept their laws. It is certain that <hi>vows teſtified</hi> by ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or <hi>viſible</hi> ſacred <hi>ſign</hi> or pledge have a deeper impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:106285:170"/> to retain the devote in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, than if they were ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply received in thought, and the whole tranſaction paſſed not without the breſt. And in this office the particular <hi>rites</hi> we undergoe, in their very intent, repreſent our being buried with Chriſt, and with him riſing again: which two being by us engaged unto, and in the particular paſſages of our Lives reflected upon, cannot but moſt naturally quicken us to our duty, by minding us that now we have a long time profeſſed and proteſted to be as <hi>dead</hi> men to every <hi>vitious</hi> ſollicitation, and as perſons vivified, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and livelily inſpirited to every <hi>virtuous</hi> practice.</p>
                     <p>Then as to <hi>Gods part</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:106285:170"/> we pretend, that he by this Sacrament makes over unto the baptiſed the <hi>pardon</hi> of all paſt ſin, conveies into the mind, a <hi>ſupernatural</hi> and divine <hi>power,</hi> which we call the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> whereby the perſon is enabled, if he will comply therewith, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the fealty undertaken, and <hi>laſtly, ſeals</hi> unto the ſaid perſon, upon his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this fealty, the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> of an happy and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reward. Which things if they are true, as Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity pretends and divine ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles aſſure us, it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that as baptiſm on <hi>our</hi> ſides obliges us to virtue, ſo on <hi>Gods,</hi> it <hi>ingenerates virtue</hi> in us, or enables us to and confirms us in it; withal <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring</hi>
                        <pb n="312" facs="tcp:106285:171"/> us of a moſt bleſſed <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> the hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which will be of force to bear up our minds, and fill them with heroick courage, conſtancy and reſolution in the moſt difficult parts of Chriſtian Duty, that is to ſay of any virtue.</p>
                     <p>It may poſſibly be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged conceiveable that <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> may have much of this <hi>efficacy,</hi> if adminiſtred to <hi>adult</hi> and underſtanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who conſider what they do and undertake: but whereas ordinarily amongſt Chriſtians it is adminiſtred unto <hi>infants,</hi> inſenſible of their vow and condition, it is not ſo readily intelligible, how it ſhould become ſuch a Sovereign expedient unto
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:106285:171"/> virtue. To which I anſwer, that as to baptized Infants <hi>dying</hi> in that their <hi>infant ſtate,</hi> I do not conceive my ſelf bound to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; becauſe I know not, nor may any man define on what eaſy terms God may receive them to bliſs: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not upon the terms of perſonal virtue, of which, as far as we can ſee, he hath by the courſe of nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they be uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subjects. Its efficacy therefore as to theſe, I leave as a more occult and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable part of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; in the mean while not doubting it, as being able to believe that effect, the manner of whoſe being ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected I do not underſtand.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:106285:172"/> But as to perſons baptized while Infants and after <hi>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up,</hi> it is eaſy to conceive how Baptiſm may operate to virtue in ſuch perſons, as ſoon as they come to be capable Subjects of virtue, that is, ſenſible that they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and what their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm meant, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing imaginable which can hinder its efficacy upon them proportionably to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably hinder the ſame in the adult perſon. And it is as rational as pious to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that many of thoſe <hi>good affections</hi> and ſweet diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to virtue which appear in ſeveral baptized Children growing up are the effects of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:106285:172"/> baptiſmal grace, or that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural power, before ſaid to be by God in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm made over and ſecretly conveyed into the baptized: I may then conclude <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> although an office of poſitive Worſhip, yet to have been of moſt reaſonable inſtitution, a miſtery contrived by the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom of God for our good, and <hi>neceſſary</hi> by reaſon of its conducency to virtue.</p>
                     <p>The nature of what we call the other Sacrament, the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> is plain by what we have ſpoken of this. We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it beſides that it is a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial</hi> of our Lords Death to be a <hi>badg</hi> of our Chriſtianity, and becauſe a ſecond, and conſequent one to that of <hi>baptiſm,</hi> therefore an office <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcing</hi>
                        <pb n="316" facs="tcp:106285:173"/> that baptiſmal <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> an holy rite and ſymbol by which we reaſſume the ſame vow as before with new reſolution and more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate purpoſe of mind. It muſt therefore firſt, have an <hi>equal force</hi> with that of baptiſm to implant and confirm virtue, and beſides that, ſuch <hi>additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtrength,</hi> which <hi>repeated</hi> and more deliberate <hi>vows</hi> uſe to have. In ſhort, how <hi>ſtrict</hi> an <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi> that is, which Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans believe this office lays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them unto all parts of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may appear, <hi>partly</hi> from the <hi>preparation,</hi> which we ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally teach to be neceſſary to the participation hereof, and <hi>partly</hi> from the very <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> partaken of, and their <hi>intent</hi> and ſignification. As to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:106285:173"/> matter of preparation, we teach every perſon who <hi>eateth</hi> of this bread and <hi>drinketh</hi> of this Cup, not having before <hi>examined</hi> himſelf of his Souls ſtate, or not <hi>renouncing</hi> all <hi>known ſin,</hi> and honeſtly <hi>reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> to endeavour univerſally an <hi>holy life,</hi> every ſuch perſon ſo eating is <hi>guilty of the body and blood of</hi> his Saviour, or <hi>eateth</hi> and <hi>drinketh damnation</hi> to himſelf. We uſually there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both direct and practice ſtrict <hi>ſelf-examination, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, humiliation, prayer,</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> to capacitate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves to be meet partakers of this holy myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Conſequently then, all that efficacy towards virtue, which any of theſe now na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med practices have in them,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:106285:174"/> muſt this Sacrament bring with it, and enſure us of by that very <hi>preparatory temper</hi> and ſtate of Soul, to which it ſo ſtrictly obligethus. Then further, inaſmuch as the <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> do livelily repreſent the crucified body and ſhed blood of our Saviour, and we in moſt ſolemn and ſacred manner receive them, as of <hi>ſuch import</hi> and further <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick energy,</hi> we are by this holy reception, as often as by us repeated, led to be <hi>ſo mindful</hi> of and <hi>faithful</hi> to our moſt ſacredly reaſſumed <hi>vows</hi> of virtue, <hi>as</hi> we do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any good from our Lords paſſion, or would not have that <hi>horrid guilt</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving and effecting it charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us; than which there
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:106285:174"/> cannot be imagined any more powerful incentive to the ſtricteſt holineſs as to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever points or degrees of it are here practicable.</p>
                     <p>To conclude what I ſhall ſay on this ſubject: if there be any amongſt us who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not that <hi>myſtical virtue</hi> of the Sacraments above in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated, which conſiſts in the <hi>divine benediction</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> that communicants are generally believed to be made partakers of in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and ſo ſhould ſeem to hold only <hi>man</hi> and not <hi>God</hi> concerned in this affair, yet if they will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge only man ſo concerned as above, which it is not eaſy to ſee how they can evade, even according to their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:106285:175"/> ſtill this office retains a ſingular efficacy or availa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to virtue. By none, who can pretend to any faith which may be called Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in this point, can leſs be admitted touching this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, than (1.) that it is a <hi>badg</hi> of our <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and Symbol of our Faith and profeſſion, (2.) that it is a <hi>pledge</hi> of our confederacy and <hi>communion,</hi> (3.) a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of Chriſts death,</hi> and (4.) a <hi>thanksgiving</hi> or Euchariſtical rite <hi>for it.</hi> Now take it but under theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſee if it be not under each particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributive to virtue. <hi>Firſt,</hi> as it is a badge of our Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it minds and obligeth us to approve our ſelves

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> THE ſum of what we have hitherto cleared is, that there muſt be ſome

Now the <hi>divine right</hi> of the <hi>offices</hi> cannot I preſume be doubted admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the divine authority or <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Scripture;</hi> or in caſe it ſhould, we have made it ſufficiently evident from Scripture, as to each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, in another tract to <note place="margin">Method for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which this diſcourſe refers. And then generally the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> cannot be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned admitting the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> For if there be any ſuch thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt mankind as a <hi>true Religion,</hi> beſides that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is ſuppoſed <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> (as we have above pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there is) that Religion muſt be the <hi>true</hi> one which
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:106285:183"/> the ſupreme God <hi>ordained.</hi> So that to ſay the Chriſtian is the true Religion, is to ſay that it was ordained by God. If therefore Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were ordained by God (as it muſt be confeſt it was if it be the true Religion) then muſt thoſe Oracles or Records which do contain the particulars or offices whereof this Religion is made up contain ſuch things as the ſupreme God enjoined to men, which is all that at preſent we mean by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral truth of Scripture. (I have uſed the term of <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral truth</hi> to avoid what might be objected touching various readings, which if various and ſo various as we know they are in both Teſtaments,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:106285:183"/> ſome muſt be falſe: but this as above ſaid prejudices not our cauſe). So that in fine, to ſay the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is the <hi>true Religion,</hi> and to ſay holy <hi>Scripture</hi> is of <hi>divine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or <hi>true</hi> in our ſenſe, is but one and the ſame thing. For all Chriſtians in common do agree that Scripture contains the eſſentials, and body of their Religion: and all who acknowledge their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on true, muſt becauſe it is the ſubſtance of what is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture acknowledge the great things which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contains to be true, that is, revealed or preſcribed from above.

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:106285:184"/> did we intend to be large, it having been infinitely better done, by many hands, than we can pretend to.

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:106285:185"/> from Chriſt muſt be confeſt to be before Chriſts coming. But if we conſider that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes <hi>Judaiſm</hi> once to have been the true Religion, and builds upon and perfects it, it cannot be ſaid, but Judaiſm being long before extant, a great part of Chriſtianity was ſo alſo.

Of the <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi> part of the Jewiſh Law, made up of certain <hi>typical obſervations</hi> and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Chriſtianity exhibits the <hi>real ſubſtance:</hi> that is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>truths</hi> were delivered of old to the Jew under <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi>

So that even many of the Chriſtian truths, or <hi>doctrinals,</hi> may have been ſaid <hi>extant before</hi> Chriſt, though in a different manner from that, wherein they are now known. Theſe things therefore conſidered, it is not unreaſonable to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Hiſtory of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity extant before Chriſt. Now that I ſay, whatever it is, delivers ſo much as makes up an <hi>undeniable evidence</hi> of the truth of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I mean of its <hi>divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</hi>

                        <hi>law.</hi> For beſides that we have the Book in our hands, and the tradition of the Jews living; in multitude of Books, which we credit in other things, we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of his laws, and the antient ſtate and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the Jews. Yea we find <hi>Moſes</hi> Law <hi>tranſlated</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other tongues ſome <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> of years before the birth of Chriſt, all which are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments beyond contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth of its being before extant.</p>
                     <p>Nor, <hi>thirdly,</hi> can it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that beſides the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> had, long <hi>before Chriſts</hi> time; certain other Books, which they did and their poſterity ſtill do believe to have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

He that believes any thing of Hiſtory, that he reads, cannot diſbelieve this.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe things being granted, if we compare Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity (the truths and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of it) with what is extant in thoſe Books, we muſt needs acknowledge what is contended for. It is certain the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> did <hi>foretel</hi> that a <hi>Prophet God ſhould raiſe,</hi> a <hi>man</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, who ſhould come with
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:106285:187"/> 
                        <hi>greater Authority</hi> than he did, and muſt accordingly be more hearkened unto and regarded: It is plain he <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies</hi> that <hi>Prophet</hi> ſhould be of the <hi>ſeed of Abraham,</hi> and that by <hi>Iſaacs</hi> poſterity, and more particularly of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> but not born till the <hi>Scepter was departed from Judah.</hi> The <hi>Prophets</hi> yet are more expreſs: they ſpecifie the very <hi>place</hi> of his <hi>Birth, Bethlehem,</hi> the <hi>time</hi> of it, a multitude of <hi>circumſtances</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi> and then the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of his <hi>death,</hi> the <hi>deſtruction of Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>diſperſion of</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> on this occaſion, the <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of his <hi>doctrine,</hi> both in his <hi>life (not to be regarded)</hi> and <hi>after his Death</hi> (to <hi>take</hi>
                        <pb n="346" facs="tcp:106285:188"/> in the <hi>whole inhabited World).</hi> To inſtance in one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prophecy: <hi>Daniel</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms tells us, that <hi>from the going forth of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to reſtore and build</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>unto</hi> Meſſiah <hi>the Prince ſhould be ſeven weeks, and threeſcore and two weeks ſhould the ſtreet be built again, and the Wall even in troublous times.</hi> And <hi>after threeſcore and two weeks ſhould the</hi> Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah <hi>be cut off but not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the people, of a Prince to come, ſhould deſtroy the City and the ſanctuary, and after the end of the War deſolations were determined.</hi> What is more plain than that the time of the reſtauration of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of the Birth of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> of his Death (and perhaps
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:106285:188"/> its deſign) of the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Country is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told? If any one ſay, this is in <hi>obſcure</hi> and <hi>Aenigmatical</hi> terms, I anſwer it is in ſuch, as all <hi>Prophecies</hi> of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>uſe</hi> to be writ: and that there is the ſame <hi>reaſon</hi> for the <hi>myſteriouſneſs</hi> of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>language,</hi> as God had for not making man <hi>preſcient.</hi> I do not here conceive need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to anſwer that old calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Porphyry</hi> that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> was writ af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe things were done. For we will ſuppoſe it muſt be <hi>writ</hi> either by a <hi>plagiary Jew</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian: Jew would</hi> not write what muſt be ſo much againſt himſelf, as to make him and his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly add one thing more before I ſum up the evidence from this part of the Hiſtory of Chriſtianity: And that is; that <hi>Moſes</hi> his <hi>law,</hi> moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by frequently repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted means, foretells, that the way for the <hi>expiation</hi> of ſins muſt be by a <hi>bloudy ſacrifice,</hi> and the Prophets yet more expreſly, that it ſhould be the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> who <hi>ſhould make his Soul an offering for ſin;</hi> which thing is the <hi>principal Dogma</hi> of Chriſtianity, that <hi>by the Death of Chriſt all who believe obtain remiſſions of ſins.</hi>

Nay their <hi>poſterity,</hi> ſtill in being, <hi>acknowledge</hi> their Forefathers to have contrived and effected this matter, and their <hi>City</hi> and Temple ſoon after <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> their Nation diſperſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that now the being of the far greater part of it, is
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:106285:192"/> not by themſelves known. And themſelves, as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours ever ſince, <hi>wander</hi> and <hi>ſojorn</hi> in the Countryes of Aliens, deſpiſed, hated, ſcarce tolerated to live. All which <hi>calamities,</hi> though they are willing to refer to other feigned and imaginary cauſes, it is certain their old, and (as they confeſs, and we have ſeen) undoubted <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> did <hi>foretell</hi> ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them for their <hi>rejecting</hi> and putting to death of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> All theſe evidences are plain matter of fact, and ſo render that, for which they are alledged, undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is no leſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that not only Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but other perſons, whom
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:106285:192"/> in his life time he inſtructed as <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and after his death commiſſioned as <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> taught and <hi>promulged</hi> the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> called Chriſtian, and in the end moſt of them <hi>died</hi> for the <hi>teſtimony</hi> thereof: both he and they having before in their life time wrought many ſtrange things, deſervedly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>miracles,</hi> and <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>a divine power</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt a <hi>divine truth.</hi> Beſides that we have the <hi>names</hi> of all the Apoſtles, frequent in our ſacred <hi>records</hi> (which no one in this point will ſuſpect of falſity) we find the names of ſome of them even in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> Monuments: the <hi>Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres</hi> of ſome of them are to be ſeen at this day; at leaſt, every where throughout the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:106285:193"/> Chriſtian World, goodly <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks</hi> and <hi>Temples</hi> dedicated to their memory. Then as to their and their Lords mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, ſome of them are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers, others by <hi>Jewiſh</hi> (both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <hi>enemies</hi> to Chriſtianity) and they are generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the writings of the moſt early adverſaries of Chriſtianity; who (by the way) had beſt means by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining particular <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> (as of <hi>places,</hi> where they were done, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> to find out their truth, or convict their falſity. Thoſe adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries going about to aſſign other cauſes of them (as it is a kind of confeſſion of the matter of fact, ſo) if lookt into, ingenders ſtronger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:106285:193"/> that they were wrought by divine power. Who can think all done by the power of <hi>Magick,</hi> which the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by theſe miracles aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſtroyed? And what more ridiculous, than that the Cabaliſtical <hi>interpretation</hi> of a <hi>name</hi> ſhould prove a charm able to effect miracles in ſo great <hi>number</hi> and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety? Theſe things then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus certain, to proceed we ſay,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> None will deny that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of Chriſt <hi>preached</hi> unto the World that their <hi>Lord,</hi> after his ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and moſt direful death, <hi>roſe again,</hi> and converſed with them ſeveral times. Our records expreſly tell us that they did thus preach, and
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:106285:194"/> make the being a <hi>witneſs of the reſurrection</hi> an eſſential part of being an <hi>Apoſtle:</hi> nor is there any reaſon why we ſhould doubt, but they did aſſert, what we are there told they did. Now it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought, they ſhould have perſiſted even to death publiſhing and witneſſing thus much, except it had been really true, that they had ſeen and converſed with him according as they affirmed. The very <hi>talking</hi> of a <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> (as we read) made them <hi>ridiculous</hi> even in the judgment of <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> It incenſed againſt them both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Heathen,</hi> who for this reaſon, amongſt others, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, buffeted, ſcourged, and by all means <hi>tormented</hi>
                        <pb n="359" facs="tcp:106285:194"/> and <hi>perſecuted</hi> them to <hi>death.</hi> This their experience told them to be the great recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which their witneſs in moſt places would find. All the profit, pleaſure, reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then, which they could forecaſt to themſelves was a <hi>complication of troubles,</hi> tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and death, being laught at by wiſe and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; in a word the want of all things but miſeries. And who would go about with a <hi>devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ly</hi> on ſuch terms?</p>
                     <p>The very ſtory it ſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us not to believe them <hi>abuſed:</hi> that they ſhould a conſiderable time behold him, diſcourſe with him, eat and drink with him, handle his body, and this ſeveral times done, and by ſeveral
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:106285:195"/> perſons, by the eleven Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples altogether, by above five hundred at once, is not conſiſtent with the nature of a deluſory Phantome.</p>
                     <p>That they ſhould be <hi>beſides themſelves</hi> is as incredible: all their other actions ſpeak them not only <hi>diſcreet</hi> but <hi>virtuous.</hi> And do <hi>mad</hi> men go about <hi>working miracles,</hi> and ſucceed in the <hi>perſwade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the practice of their own madneſs to the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and greateſt of their Spectatours and hearers? It remains then that they teſtified what they knew to be true, that they had <hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>ſpoke</hi> with their <hi>riſen Lord,</hi> and conſequently that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did indeed <hi>riſe from the dead</hi> as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; than which there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:106285:195"/> be a greater teſtimony from any matter of fact of the truth of that Religion he planted. For that Chriſt ſhould <hi>preach a new Religion</hi> that he ſhould <hi>affirm</hi> it was <hi>from Heaven,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>work miracles</hi> to prove it ſo, that he ſhould <hi>witneſs it to death</hi> and by death, yet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling to the World <hi>death</hi> ſhould <hi>not</hi> be able to <hi>hold</hi> him, that he ſhould accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly at the time foretold <hi>ariſe again,</hi> and ſhew himſelf, that he ſhould <hi>take witneſs</hi> hereof ſo publickly, that he ſhould ſend <hi>others</hi> to <hi>preach</hi> what he had done, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm</hi> all by <hi>their miracles,</hi> as he ſaid <hi>greater than himſelf had wrought,</hi> all which things deſcend to us by ſuch noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:106285:196"/> evidence that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any reaſon diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any one point of them, that I ſay all theſe ſhould be and yet <hi>all a cheat,</hi> no one can think who thinks not <hi>God</hi> and <hi>providence</hi> ſuch alſo, which thought cannot be ſuppoſed incident the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Devil.</p>
                     <p>Now then it only remains to conſider the Hiſtory of Chriſtian Religion, its <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>progreſs ſince</hi> the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe great founders and witneſſes of it: And here we ſhall take notice only of <hi>two</hi> conſiderables, both of them of undeniable truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is reported and believed throughout all the Chriſtian World, that
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:106285:196"/> the above mentioned <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of our Saviour did not only by <hi>word</hi> of mouth <hi>preach</hi> and witneſs the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine,</hi> but ſome of them <hi>conſign</hi> it <hi>in Books,</hi> which Books are conſtantly reported to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as the genuine works of their reputed Authors, in the firſt and next Ages to them (who had the beſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of examining them) and in all Ages ſince ſucceeding. And we find by thoſe numerous Doctours, who have written of thoſe <hi>Books,</hi> that they have been in all Ages moſt <hi>religiouſly kept,</hi> and are the <hi>ſame</hi> for <hi>ſubſtance</hi> now as ever: and, finally, that all in all Ages, who profeſſed to believe
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:106285:197"/> Chriſtianity (except ſome vitious lewd perſons, who would be denominated from that name, but caſt off the thing) have appealed to theſe <hi>Books</hi> as the <hi>records of their Faith,</hi> and ſo ſtill doth the preſent Chriſtian Age. If this Religion then ever were true, we cannot, conſidering the premiſes, but believe it is <hi>ſtill true:</hi> for the <hi>preſent Chriſtianity</hi> is <hi>conſonant</hi> to the records of the <hi>old,</hi> and thoſe <hi>records</hi> ſtill the <hi>ſame</hi> for <hi>ſubſtance</hi> as ever.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Let us conſider how <hi>innumerable</hi> the <hi>Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes</hi> of Chriſtiany, for this ſixteen hundred and odd years, have been, and how vaſtly numerous they ſtill are. It is undeniable that
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:106285:197"/> Chriſtian Religion hath tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled through moſt or all the known and habited World. <hi>Every Country</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Monuments</hi> of it: Yea there hath been a <hi>new Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> partly made out of it, which now is received in a very conſiderable part of the World, I mean <hi>Mahumeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm.</hi> In all theſe Countries it hath been received by men of all <hi>Ages, Sexes,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi> poor and rich, mighty and mean, learned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. It hath made <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> of the moſt <hi>vitious</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>magnanimous</hi> (even to the contempt of death and rejoicing in it and all its pomps and precedaneous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) of the <hi>weakeſt minds</hi> ſuch as thoſe of Women and
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:106285:198"/> Children. And yet in the mean time nothing ſo unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have taken as this.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of its more <hi>peculiar precepts</hi> they are ſuch as <hi>thwart</hi> all carnal and <hi>ſecular intereſts.</hi> They enjoin under the pain of eternal torment and miſery the <hi>renouncing all</hi> that can be <hi>dear</hi> to man, Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Brothers, Country, Eſtate, Honour, Pleaſure, Health, in a word <hi>life</hi> it ſelf, in caſe any or all of them come in competition with <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Virtue.</hi> That is, if I muſt deny Chriſt, or commit any other ſin, or elſe not live, or not enjoy any thing I count pretious, I am enjoined by the Chriſtian law as I would not be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:106285:198"/> to quit whatſoever it is I can looſe rather than mine integrity.</p>
                     <p>Then as to the <hi>perſons</hi> who were <hi>ſent</hi> about with this <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful errand,</hi> our records tell us they were at firſt a parcel of <hi>ſtupid, puſillanimous, unlettered, mechanick,</hi> and <hi>contemptible</hi> men: yea, after they had been <hi>ennobled</hi> by their errand, and received all the advance and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their minds which inſpiration gave them, in thoſe very <hi>Books,</hi> which ſome of them have writ (as we believe, by <hi>inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)</hi> they have left foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps and evidences of their <hi>unskillfullneſs</hi> in <hi>humane li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Finally, the <hi>oppoſition</hi> which
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:106285:199"/> this unlikely Doctrine, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by aſſertours ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to ſucceed, did at firſt and during the time of its more conſiderable <hi>propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> receive, was <hi>ſuch</hi> as makes it clearly a <hi>miracle</hi> that both <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> were not long ago <hi>extinct,</hi> and darkneſs and oblivion have dwelt ſo much as upon the very names of both; Jew and Heathan, Greek and Barbarian, every where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it their buſineſs to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them as early as might be, and before they grew too publick. Notwithſtanding all which (maugre all force and craft) this Doctrine run over the World, as our Lord foretold it ſhould like <hi>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening:</hi> without any violence
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:106285:199"/> ſaving what it ſuffered, it ſucceeded every where: The <hi>extinguiſhing</hi> its <hi>witneſſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminated</hi> and <hi>confirm'd</hi> it, inſomuch that it fill'd City and Country, Camp, and Court, and it ſoon became in a manner as impoſſible to pitch a mans abode out of the <hi>World</hi> as out of the <hi>Church.</hi> All which being duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no rational and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative perſon can impute this ſucceſs to any thing but a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power defending</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading what it <hi>had revealed.</hi> I do profeſs, this very one thing ſeems to me ſufficient to convince any unbiaſſed perſon that Chriſtianity could have no other Authour but the ſupreme God. And that ancient famous <hi>Italian</hi>
                        <pb n="370" facs="tcp:106285:200"/> Poet had great reaſon to ſing, as he doth, when bringing in St. <hi>Peter</hi> Catechizing him touching the reaſon of his belief of thoſe miracles, by which he had been told Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion was aſſerted, he moſt acutely anſwers,</p>

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:106285:203"/> which the precepts of this Religion impoſe, they are either duties <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> The natural, by being ſo, are moſt conſonant to reaſon; and though the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which enjoin them are rules of <hi>higher ſanctity</hi> and juſtice, than meer reaſon would or <hi>could</hi> have given, yet <hi>being given</hi> they are ſuch as it muſt <hi>needs approve.</hi> And as to all <hi>poſitive offices,</hi> their <hi>reaſonableneſs</hi> and <hi>conducive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to virtue,</hi> we have ſeen particularly. There hath therefore as <hi>great evidence</hi> been given of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> as any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this nature can, at ſuch diſtance from its firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the World, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:106285:203"/> and far greater than of any other paſt matter of fact whatſoever which we believe. Wherefore, if we will be <hi>juſt</hi> to our <hi>reaſon,</hi> we muſt conclude it <hi>true.</hi> And if it be <hi>true</hi> (as above made out) Holy <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>true</hi> alſo. And if that be true, then we are obliged as much, as by divine Authority we can be, to <hi>Prayer, Sacraments, Hearing, reading or medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>offices of Chriſtian po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive worſhip.</hi> And then that opinion which pretendeth it ſufficient men <hi>live honeſtly,</hi> nor need they <hi>concern</hi> or trouble <hi>themſelves</hi> about <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prayers,</hi> frequenting <hi>Sacraments</hi> and <hi>Sermons</hi>
                        <pb n="378" facs="tcp:106285:204"/> and ſuch <hi>devotions</hi> is not as it would be thought a more <hi>free</hi> and <hi>generous ſtrain</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but a plain <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of <hi>impiety,</hi> directly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> in breeding men to the neglect of paying him what is his due, that is, what he requires; and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive</hi> of Chriſtian Religion, the <hi>poſitive</hi> precepts of which (of no leſs divine Authority then the natural) it flatly contrariates, and lays a Foundation for the neglect or not performance of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural duties,</hi> while it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys or lifts out thoſe means and helps which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom preſcribed to further and ſecure ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, I mean <hi>poſitive</hi>
